  - for localgs, listing workspaces entrypoints
  - analysing the presence of md uuid (and their existance) (from sdi-cc)
- a page by layer:
  - backlinking to the ogc service
  - for a gs source, linking to per-layer getcapabilities
  - linking to mapstore to open the layer
  - displaying getlegend graphics for available styles
  - listing/linking to the ms maps/contexts using this layer
- a page for the local catalog
